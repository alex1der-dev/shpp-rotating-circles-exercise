# shpp-rotating-circles-exercise 

The screen should display X points, of which all except the central one rotate in quadrature (each point gradually moves to the position of the other). 

The number X may be 9, 25, 49, ... (in general to make a full square)
(The central circle doesn't move anywhere, of course)
The circles should be multi-colored.
Initially all the circles of each square move counterclockwise 
When you click on any of the circles of the square, the whole square should start moving in the other direction.
